<h2>🔨 How it Works:</h2>

The Cloud works with a Frontend that you can host by yourself or on GitHub (yes you can host a Part of it on GitHub for free) and the Other Part inside your Home. This is working because of the Backend, the Frontend should only be a Mostly Static Website that has only HTML, JavaScript and CSS and works on every machine. The Backend does the Authentication and the Resource giving so that the Frontend only know where to Connect and what it displays thru the Backend!
