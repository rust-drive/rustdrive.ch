<p id="description">This project aims to create an intuitive cloud. I host a Nextcloud but some of my clients are confused by the amount of options they are given. Just to look at a file's details there are multiple tabs and options. So i decided that it is time again for a Project. It will probably only be for learning purposes but you never know.</p>

<h2>🔨 How it works:</h2>

The Cloud works with a Frontend that you can host yourself or on GitHub (yes you can host a part of it on GitHub for free) and the other part at home. This works because of the Backend, the Frontend should be a mostly static website that only uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS and runs on every machine. The Backend does the authentication and resource management while the Frontend connects to it and displays the GUI!
